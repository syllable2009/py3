About these documents

These documents are generated from reStructuredText sources by Sphinx, a document processor specifically written for the Python documentation.
Development of the documentation and its toolchain is an entirely volunteer effort, just like Python itself. If you want to contribute, please take a look at the Dealing with Bugs page for information on how to do so. New volunteers are always welcome!

Many thanks go to:
  - Fred L. Drake, Jr., the creator of the original Python documentation toolset and writer of much of the content;
  - the Docutils project for creating reStructuredText and the Docutils suite;
  - Fredrik Lundh for his Alternative Python Reference project from which Sphinx got many good ideas.

Contributors to the Python Documentation

It is only with the input and contributions of the Python community that Python has such wonderful documentation — Thank You!

Documentation bugs

If you find a bug in this documentation or would like to propose an improvement, please submit a bug report on the tracker. If you have a suggestion how to fix it, include that as well.
If you’re short on time, you can also email documentation bug reports to docs@python.org (behavioral bugs can be sent to python-list@python.org). ’docs@’ is a mailing list run by volunteers; your request will be noticed, though it may take a while to be processed.
